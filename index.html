  	<h2>About Me</h2>
  	<p>In San Diego, CA born and raised. In front of a computer screen is where I sepnd most of my days.</p>
  	<p>As a Californian, I fall into some sterotypical attributes as a native Californian; the good ones! For instance my personality is very laid back. I love promoting positivitey and I despise bringing the vibe down. This has helped me get along with many people that I assocciate and work with. The best feeling for me is making someone smile or laugh. In my spare time, you may see me play some video games, catching up to one of many of my favorite tv shows or as the opening sentence suggests; behind a computer and having a good time.</p>
  	<p>With a background and bachelor's degree in graphic design, I came to the realization that I love web and tech. As I advanced in my career I found my true passion into creating beautiful websites and apps. With that, I set out on a quest to further enhance my abiilities and started learning front-end development. My journey to learning html, css, javascript and jquery has been a struggle that was well worth it. I don't regret this decision at all and I strive to work on projects with passion and creativity. I look forward to meeting/working with some of the best and the brightest in the business. With that said, I urge you to view my work and feel free to contact me for any business inquieries. </p>
